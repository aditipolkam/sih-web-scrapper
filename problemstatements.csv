20,SS612,"Department of Space, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).","The ionospheric electron density is sensitive to the space weather parameters like Sunspot numbers, F10.7, Interplanetary magnetic field etc. and shows variation with respect to them. 

These parameters are detected and measured at L1 point (currently by ESA / NASA satellites) and are transmitted to earth. So, the information about these parameters are available before they actually influence the terrestrial ionosphere. Importantly, all these data are freely available over internet.

The abovementioned parameters affect the ionospheric TEC, which in turn shows abrupt variations and deviations from the nominal characteristics. Therefore, these unconventionalities, which are typically observed during solar and geomagnetic storms, are necessary to be identified. This is also important, because the performance of the GNSS system, which is currently driving millions of applications, are also affected by the ionospheric variabilities. So, prediction of the TEC provides a handle to take necessary actions to avoid or mitigate the resultant impairments arising out of the above facts.

For the purpose, the time sequence of space-weather parameters, along with the local time, location, season, date etc.  can be related to the same for the vertical TEC and a definitive relationship can be established using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, like neural networks or other deep learning algorithms.
Once trained with known dataset, the AI based algorithm may be able to predict the expected TEC variations which can be used by the concerned users. The schematic for the approach may be as the following. 

The problem requires the development of the proper AI algorithm to use the available space weather and other data to predict the TEC variations at one particular location on the earth, preferably over the geomagnetic equator."

24,AG676,MathWorks,"Background: 
Navigating an intersection with traffic lights is a challenging but safety critical task for a self-driving car. Using perception to identify traffic light positions and states despite lighting conditions and occlusions is an interesting problem that a 3D simulation environment can safely and effectively provide a solution for. Automated Driving Toolbox™ provides a 3D simulation environment powered by Unreal Engine® from Epic Games® that can be used to visualize traffic lights and the motion of a vehicle in a 3D scene.
Description:
Use MATLAB® and Simulink® to load a pre-built Unreal scene, detect and identify the state of the traffic light nearest to the ego-vehicle, design a Stateflow® model to control traffic lights in the scene, and control the reaction of the ego-vehicle in accordance with the traffic lights and surrounding vehicles.
The position and color state of the traffic light at an intersection can be obtained by using a combination of sensors and perception algorithms. Perception can be used to identify surrounding vehicles which can also be used to inform decisions. Identify distance between the traffic light nearest to the ego-vehicle and the ego-vehicle in a pre-built Unreal scene intersection. Identify the color of the traffic light using camera output and perception. Control the change of state of the traffic light using Stateflow. The ego-vehicle should react to the traffic light information. Build your own scenes with the following suggested requirements and perform a quantitative analysis of your algorithm: 
a. Traffic lights obstructed by trees 
b. Various types of traffic lights like hanging on a pole, multiple traffic lights in different orientations at an intersection 
c. Scenes with different weather conditions Work with Automated Driving Toolbox™  , Computer Vision Toolbox™  , Lidar Toolbox™  and Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox™  https://www.mathworks.com/products/sensor-fusion-and-tracking.html for this project.

28,DR705,All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).,"Background: Passwords are ubiquitous today on any platform, on possibly any website. But to remember so difficult passwords and that too on numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project illustrating graphical password strategy. This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern to login o the system. Summary:  Remembering numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a user. So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password.  Objective:  : In this method, the user is required to select some images (let’s say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example dairy milk is followed by 5 stars which is in turn followed by KitKat and so on). Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially. Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it. We need techniques that can be easily implemented and provide better results to this process."

While retirements are mandatory on superannuation, steps to fill up the vacancy that arises immediately is lacking. When a vacancy arises in the middle of the academic year on account of the superannuation of a faculty, the students are the victims. There should be state or National registry or databank to assess the actual faculty requirement college-wise keeping in view the date of retirement and number of teachers who retire, so that recruitment process can start well in advance and the faculty is readily available as soon as a faculty retires. Standard of education in India cannot be improved unless we fill all the vacancies every year selecting suitable candidates.

Between April 2021 and October 2021, coal production in India stood at 379.597 million tons (MT). Coal is the main pillar of India’s energy sector. In 2021, it said, India consumed 93.2 crore tons of coal, 77% of which came from domestic production and 90% of which was used for power generation.
The National Foundation of India study said that crores of Indians depend on the coal economy directly or indirectly. It highlighted that more than 1.3 crore Indians are employed in coal mining, transport, power, sponge iron, steel and bricks sectors.

Mining workers are affected by many hazards – from ventilation problems, mine flooding, gas explosions, ceiling collapsing, mine haulage, sudden inrushes and mine inundation, spontaneous combustion, to un-optimized evacuation routes. There is no exact solution that can forecast these risks and avoid them even before they occur.
 Summary: Mining workers are affected by many hazards – from ventilation problems, mine flooding, gas explosions, ceiling collapsing, mine haulage, sudden inrushes and mine inundation, spontaneous combustion, to un-optimized evacuation routes. And mine operators have been working for decades to ensure no fatal accident results in death, injury, or poor health of miners.  Objective: To give a solution to design smart work clothing that has sensors embedded in it to securely transmit data to managers about hazardous conditions and the workers’ physical conditions, improving safety overall."""
62,NC739,Coal India Limited,"""Background: In 2014, India became the second country in the world (after Mauritius) to mandate spend on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by introducing specific provisions through Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (CA 2013). The new law required companies to spend in a given financial year, at-least two percent of their average net profits earned over the preceding three financial years subject to satisfying certain qualifying conditions. The Board of Directors were required to explain reasons for underspend, if any, in the company’s Annual Report. 
Over the years, these provisions underwent changes and more recently, with an objective to reinforce compliance, anti-abuse and strengthen governance, transparency and flexibility, the MCA has introduced significant changes through the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020 and the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Amendment Rules, 2021 to amend the CA 2013 and its related rules. 
The amended rules became effective from 22 January 2021 and require close review as they directly impact implementation of a company’s CSR initiatives and also introduce new concepts like a specific negative list in the CSR definition, mandatory treatment of CSR underspend, mandatory impact assessment, mandatory registration by NGOs undertaking CSR activities, etc. These changes are likely to trigger impact across regulatory, accounting, finance and tax domains.
Coal mining industry is not a clean industry and there is a need for balancing between the development opportunities provided by the industry and its environmental as well as social impacts. 
In response to the international call for sustainable development, integration of CSR measures in core operations of all business companies in India has been made mandatory and most of the companies claim compliance of the statute. 
The Indian coal mining industry has been making substantial expenditure and effort towards CSR initiatives since years in order to meet the legal requirements and international expectations. A study was required to analyze as to what extent CSR initiatives of the industry contribute to sustainable development, i.e. to what extent the use of natural resources and the environment is possible, given the current level of economic activity; what responsibilities the industry should bear in order to achieve sustainable development goals on its part and how far it has gone adopting CSR initiatives. 

Currently there is no mechanism to monitor the progress of a coal mining CSR project on a real time basis. Summary: Since the Corporate social investment can help businesses build a reputation as a responsible business, which in turn, lead to competitive advantage. Corporates sometime may take undue advantage of CSR projects to save taxes, attract investments, media attention, forge relations with local authorities to turn the bids in their favor etc. by announcing a big fund or categorizing a project under CSR.
Amended CSR rules has cast enhanced obligation on the Board, CSR Committee and Chief Financial Officer of the Company for monitoring, evaluation and reporting of CSR activities of the Company.
In light of the detailed requirements, a Company needs to assess and put in place, suitable mechanisms to collate the data required for disclosures. Also, an evaluation of the completeness of financial disclosures in the Annual Report is required CSR Rules mandatorily require impact assessment report to be placed before the Board and the reports to be annexed to the Annual Report on CSR. Companies should evaluate whether the full impact assessment report should be annexed to the report or an abridged version could be appended, with a reference to the Company’s website, if any, where the detailed report shall be hosted or provide details of a designated person who could be contacted for the full report, in case the Company does not maintain a website.
 Objective: To give a software and a hardware solution that can identify, track and monitor the progress of the project on a real time basis. The solution should also have the capability to store a databank of all the assets created and give the analytics from the same."""
63,NC740,Coal India Limited,"""Background: Mining operations are generally spread over a vast area in remote locations and harsh environments. Coal extraction is a high cost and increasingly high technology venture that requires the utmost operational efficiency as well as uninterrupted workflow and delivery cycles. Operations cannot afford to be impacted due to lack of visibility as to the location and status of machinery, equipment and vehicles, since this causes delays, increased cost and mounting losses and is also an open invitation to theft and misuse. Real-time location tracking and monitoring, especially of moveable assets such as the vehicle fleet transporting the coal, is thus of critical importance to the mining industry.
Tracking pickups and deliveries of thousands of truck-loads moving daily to and from various locations inside mining areas to processing plants, rail wagons or jetties is a logistics nightmare.

Moving vehicle registration plate detection: 
RFID is fitted with vehicles moving across the mining region. The RFIDs are mapped to their respective registration number. It happens that two vehicles may exchange registration plates for malicious purpose including theft or forgery.
A system is to be created to extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. The data captured should be transferred to cloud environment which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading.
 Summary: In general, most companies employ an active (battery-powered) radio frequency identification system to track trucks entering and leaving a mine with a load. This can be accomplished via a real-time location system (RTLS) if there are vehicles parked that need to be located quickly.
But more commonly, an active RFID transponder is affixed to a vehicle, with readers set up at various points—at a mine’s entry gate, at a weigh station, at an exit and so forth. Software tracks the truck’s location, and you can usually run a variety of reports. The best solution really depends on the type of information that you would like to collect and use.
 Objective: To create an anti-theft auto security system that can extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. And can capture and transfer data to cloud, which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading."""
64,NC741,Coal India Limited,"""Background: When the causes of fatal accident in coal mines are analyzed for the last 43 years since nationalization of coal mines, it is clearly observed that there are five major causes, such as Ground movement, Fall other than fall of ground, Transportation machinery (other than winding), machinery other than transportation machinery and explosives which contributes almost 91% of the total accident. That is why we divided the cause of the accident into five groups and rest of causes are in one group. 
Accidents due to ground movement contributed 41%, transportation of machinery (other than winding in shaft) contributing 31% along with Machinery Other than Transportation Machinery, Explosive and Fall (other than the fall of Ground) which contributed 6%, 4% and 9% respectively.
When the last thirty-three years of fatal accident due to dumper and wheeled trackless transportation (truck, tractor, tanker) machinery data of Indian coal mining industry was further analyzed, an average number of accidents due to trackless transportation machinery (wheeled) came out to be quite high ranging from 47.2 to 28.3 per year.

In Coal mining a dumper is loaded with Coal and then transported to specific location. Many such dumpers does not have load cells to measure the loaded quantity.
 Summary: In Coal mining a dumper is loaded with Coal and then transported to specific location. Many such dumpers do not have load cells to measure the loaded quantity. 
To make money, transporters prefer carrying more than the prescribed quantity of coal in their vehicles. Overloading exceeds the load rating of tires and braking system on a dump truck and extends the total stopping distance of the vehicle. In an emergency braking scenario, brakes get hot quickly and lose their effectiveness. Hence increasing the chances of accidents resulting in fatalities.
Routine and regular overloading increases the wear and tear on structural, steering, chassis and suspension components which leads to a less than reliable hydraulic system. When drivers attempt to lift the dump bed, the hydraulic ram isn’t strong enough to lift the load. When the truck is parked on an angle, the additional weight of an overloaded dump bed causes the truck to tip to the side.
Many a times overloading causes the truck to skid, resulting in a head-on crash or rollover incident. An overloaded truck is much harder to control during an off-the-road recovery.
 Objective: The object is to provide a solution to measure the load weight of the dumper using IoT technology. The solution should give dynamic measurements based of coal loaded into the dumper which will help stop overloading of the dumper and hence mitigate the risks of fatal accidents."""
65,VM742,Ministry of Consumer Affairs,"""Background: In 2017, the government was struggling to keep prices of the essential vegetable affordable as retail prices had crossed Rs 60 per kg in Delhi. Then Union Food Minister had expressed his helplessness in controlling onion prices and blamed reduction in the area of cultivation and hoarding by traders for the shortage. The government was forced to take measures such as procuring onions from local markets and discouraging exports to bring the prices down.
In order to keep a watch on the hoarders, the government has roped in various agencies to keep a check on the hoarding activities over the period of time. 
Also, with predictions of a """"below average"""" monsoon in the year 2019, the Central government asked procurement agencies to store at least 50,000 tons of onions to ensure that market prices remain under control in case of shortage. 
The buffer stock would be used to control prices in case there is a shortage of onions in the market.

Fluctuating weather and decreasing monsoon, causes decrease in crop (onion) output which in turn creates a demand supply gap hence leading to increase in prices or inflation. Summary: Reports from across the country indicate there has been an unnatural spike in the prices of vegetables, disrupting the carefully planned kitchen budgets of millions. An all-India survey on the retail price of vegetables like onions and tomatoes between November 18 and 28 showed that most households in big tier-1 cities forked out around Rs 100 for a kilo, while the average payout in tier-2 and tier-3 cities was Rs 80 per kg. Even the prices of sturdier staple vegetable—potato are up about 20%.
Unseasonal rains all over the country have ruined vegetable crops and disrupted market operations, creating a shortage. High diesel prices too have added to the woes of consumers as they bear the increased transport costs. The crash and spurt in prices of these essential veggies has unfortunately become an acceptable cycle. For instance, last year saw a high in onion prices in September and a huge spurt again was witnessed this February on account of unseasonal rains. Then followed a sudden spurt in production by mid-March triggering a 30-40% fall in prices. In Lasalgaon, India’s onion hub, farmers were in tears as prices crashed from Rs 4,000 a quintal to a low of Rs 2,500. The government had to take last-minute measures like banning onion exports as soon as prices soar. 
One of the reasons prices of potatoes are relatively stable compared to other vegetables is because they use 90% of the warehousing cold storage space and do not rot easily. Similar cold chain/ storage infrastructure for other important veggies, with central support, will give better returns to farmers and provide stable prices to consumers. The more perishable onions and tomatoes can be processed and stored, as is done in many advanced countries.
 Objective:  The Department wishes to create buffer stock of onions in the harvest season and keep the buffer stock intact with its food value, moisture and taste for at least a period of six months  from date of storage.  We would want the technical solution to be proposed  for the following:-
 
(a  (a)  Storage of onions in the traditional storage systems and warehouses available in the country.
  (b)  Technical solutions for storage of onions in temperature controlled storage systems, warehouses."""

The idea behind this challenge is to find the mother of all solutions to the multiple problems being faced by a government organization such as ICCR by adopting a Paperless Strategy under which ICCR will no longer issue or ask for paper documents across all of its internal and external operations. If achieved, this will not only make ICCR a fully paperless organization (the first one in GOI to embark on a path where 100 % of its internal processes and external interactions will be done digitally), but this will also eliminate the need of usinga significant quantity of paper in itsworking every year. The solution that ICCR is looking for is much more than the e-Office solution being provided by NIC, whose vision is to achieve a simplified, responsive, effective and transparent working of all Government Offices, but not to target a 100% paperless government or organization. The 6 features of the e-Office of NIC viz. SPARROW, eFile, KMS, PIMS, eTour and eLeave do not even try to help a government organization to go 100% paper-free.ICCR intends to embark on a journey to find the necessary technology and implement it within its organization to enable paper-free transactions. In case the hackathoners, during the next Smart India Hackathon 2022, are able to find an intelligent, lasting solution to this challenge in terms of suggesting a digital infrastructure and a robust and smart Document Management System (DMS) required for making ICCR a first Government of India organization to go paper-free by 31st December 2022, it would enable ICCR in becoming a smarter, faster, more transparent and thus, more accountable and more result-oriented as opposed to process-oriented organization. This “Mother of All Solutions” to most bureaucratic problems will thus set ICCR apart from other GOI organizations by helping it become a complete, round and mobile organization, in addition to, making it the first total paper-free, environment-friendly organization. ICCR does aspire to become an organization that wants to include India’s scientific temper, indigenous technology, innovation and Indian enterprise as essential parts of our Indian culture in its arsenal of soft power projection capabilities abroad.

To achieve this broad goal, a prior knowledge of the hydraulic properties of different aquifer systems is a basic necessity for almost all groundwater-related studies. The pumping test (or ‘aquifer performance test’) is the standard and most widely used method for determining the hydraulic parameters of aquifers. Pumping tests are conducted on a large scale by CGWB, State Groundwater Departments, and other Groundwater agencies for estimating the hydraulic characters of water bearing layers. Various aquifer parameters such as Transmissivity, Storativity, Specific Yield can be estimated using pumping test. Analysis and interpretation of pumping test data is a tedious process and is usually done using computer applications. However, there are no Indian software available for this purpose. Central Ground Water Board proposes to develop standalone desktop application for analysis and interpretation of pumping test data which can be distributed as freeware for use by ground water professionals, researchers, students, teachers and others. Data Source: Professionals using the software application will enter the data. The user can chose to enter the data directly using forms or import it from existing data sources. Expected Outcome: A standalone desktop application for analysis and interpretation of pumping test data.

Water supply issues are related to sources and usage of raw water; intermittent water supply and the quality of tap water at the consumers’ end. One of the major challenge facing is the high level of water loss in distribution networks. “Non-Revenue Water” (NRW) is defined as the difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the amount of water recovered from consumers. NRW is a good indicator for water utility performance; high levels of NRW typically indicate a poorly managed water utility. In addition, available NRW data are often found problematic, suspicious, inaccurate, or provide only partial information. Despite of knowing the benefits of reducing NRW, decades of effort have not delivered much improvement in India. Lack of support for comprehensive NRW management by 691788/2021/e-Governance Section 20/30 2 utility owners and chief executive officers makes it difficult to motivate utility staff and provide them with the means (funding, training, and technology) to successfully and sustainably reduce NRW.

124,BV802,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"Urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding as urbanization leads to developed catchments, which increases the flood peaks from 1.8 to 8 times and flood volumes by up to 6 times. Consequently, flooding occurs very quickly due to faster flow times (in a matter of minutes). Urban areas are densely populated and people living in vulnerable areas suffer due to flooding, sometimes resulting in loss of life. It is not only the event of flooding but the secondary effect of exposure to infection also has its toll in terms of human suffering, loss of livelihood and, in extreme cases, loss of life.Increasing trend of urban flooding is a universal phenomenon and poses a great challenge to urban planners the world over. Predicting the extent of calamity requires lots of parameters like rainfall, vegetation etc. Improper disposal of solid waste, including domestic, commercial and industrial waste and dumping of construction debris into the drains also contributes significantly to reducing their capacities. It is imperative to take better operations and maintenance actions.The main objective of this problem is to help the city managers or urban residents in for predicting the impact of urban flooding and can help them to take preventive action."
125,BV803,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"Slums have posed a huge problem for development because they are by definition areas in which the inhabitants lack fundamental resources and capabilities such as adequate sanitation, improved water supply, durable housing or adequate living space. Many governments have tried to find solutions to the problem, and one of the proposed solutions is slum upgrading. Slum upgrading is essentially a strategy in which the infrastructure of a slum is improved, such as giving adequate water supply and sewage to the community. Additionally, because of the tenuous legal status of slum inhabitants, often strategies include the legalization of the right to the land on which slums are built.Slum improvement has been a challenge for the country. Poverty, unavailability of urban land for building affordable housing, paucity of data leads to rise in slums in the country. In order to make our country healthy, inclusive and prosperous a strong approach is needed for the redevelopment of slums. Technology can play a major role in meeting the shortcomings of the data, monitoring and controlling the spread of epidemic etc. and regularise the slum settlement.This problem aims for an innovative approach for the redevelopment of the slum areas in order to avoid growth of slums in future and a technical solution to monitor and control the growth of slums in present time."

127,BV805,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"The second largest populated country in the world, India faces various hindrances to its development. Solid Waste Management is of critical concern and needs attention. Whereas many developed countries are searching for ready-made sustainable waste management solutions. The solid wastes have become a major consequence of development, modernization and urbanization. Solid waste includes useless, unwanted, discharged materials that is not liquid or gas.  The solid waste affects the natural environment to a great extent and pose a serious threat as these materials remain in one particular place or a relatively longer period of time unless removed, burned or washed away.  In this respect, solid waste has been identified as significant matter for sustainable development. Growth in population and change in lifestyle has led to an increase in solid waste generation. Both the residential and commercial waste are in solid or semi solid form. Safe and cost-effective solid waste management is a great challenge for the modern society. It is estimated that 40% of the waste remains uncollected.This research aims for a technical solution for the management of solid wastes by providing visibility on city sanitation, route planning for garbage collection, resource optimization, air quality measurements, visibility of bins in order to maximize the waste collection."
128,BV806,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"It’s hard to pinpoint the invention of the electric car to one inventor or country. Instead it was a series of breakthroughs -- from the battery to the electric motor -- in the 1800s that led to the first electric vehicle on the road. In the early part of the century, innovators in Hungary, the Netherlands and the United States -- including a blacksmith from Vermont -- began toying with the concept of a battery-powered vehicle and created some of the first small-scale electric cars. And while Robert Anderson, a British inventor, developed the first crude electric carriage around this same time, it wasn’t until the second half of the 19th century that French and English inventors built some of the first practical electric cars. Here in the U.S., the first successful electric car made its debut around 1890 thanks to William Morrison, a chemist who lived in Des Moines, Iowa. His six-passenger vehicle capable of a top speed of 14 miles per hour was little more than an electrified wagon, but it helped spark interest in electric vehicles.Under the EV rollout plan the power ministry is targeting 4 billion plus population cities under the EV policy initiative. The success of EV adoption hinges upon successful deployment of EV charging infrastructure. Location analysis for EV charging stations helps optimize utilisation and maximize benefits that include the number of EVs in the area and grid infrastructure. The core of the problem is demand and supply.The objective is to develop a sharing charging model to solve the location problem for EV charging stations."

The economic cost of the approximate 600 000 premature deaths and of the diseases caused by air pollution in the WHO European Region in 2010 has been estimated in Euro 1.5 trillion.People in Delhi/NCR are having their annual tryst with the deadly winter air pollution where toxic clouds of smog engulf this region every year around the winter months. Contributing to nearly 30% of winter air pollution in Delhi, stubble burning across the nearby states of Punjab, Haryana is attributed as one of the major factors for the existence of Air Pollution in the region during this period.The main objective is to suggest an unique approach to address the urban air pollution using Technology."
130,BV808,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"The journey of EVs started a long time ago. During the first half of the 19th century, the exploration of electrical automobiles started by several researchers of the United States, Netherlands, and Hungary. The researches lead to the invention of the first EV practical prototype by Robert Anderson.India has been a major importer of crude oil. In the year 2019-20 the import bill was around $100 billion which is a huge strain on the country’s exchequer. One possible solution to this is the augmented use of alternative fuels. Since the production of biofuels is abundance in India and it requires minimal infrastructural changes for large scale adoption, it can serve as a much easier solution to the issue. But the creation of supply chain for regular use of Biofuels is still in nascent stage.Emphasising on electric mobility suggest a proper way for the creation of supply chain for the consistent use of Biofuels."
131,BV809,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"Before the Covid-19 crisis, the public transport sector saw opportunities to explore novel approaches to boost ridership around the world. However, more people on the transport network presented issues such as overcrowding, pressure on the public transport infrastructure and the subsequent poor quality of service. Then, around late 2019 - early 2020, an outbreak of the Covid-19 virus was deemed a pandemic, forcing most countries into a complete lockdown for a few months. Imposing physical distancing on public transport vehicles is unrealistic in the long-term for obvious reasons. The urgent need to create safe spaces for both passengers and transport workers while restoring faith in mass transport has provided an exceptional incentive for our solution: Moving towards a different time schedule for some economic and social activities to distribute peak commute hours and better manage the demand in public transport networks.The current COVID situation has pulled people back to the personalized modes of transport which would lead to further worsening of traffic congestion issues along with the financial stress for the public transport companies for maintaining the regular operations. Stretching back the peak hours and maintaining higher frequencies during these stretched hours can help in reducing the crowd in the public transport. The main objective of this research is to provide an improvised solution to minimize the crowd in the public transport and managing peak load."
132,BV810,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"Though the COVID-19 pandemic is reported to have reduced air pollution and environmental-related noise and improved biodiversity and tourist sites, however, the impact of stay-at-home and preventive measures on waste management is alarming. Due to the stockpiling of gloves, gowns, masks and other protective clothing and equipment, there appears to be a waste emergency due to the unusual production of waste from both households and health facilities. Failure to properly manage the waste generated from health facilities and households may escalate the spread of COVID-19 via secondary transmission. The potential rampant dumping, open burning and incineration could affect air quality and health outcomes due to the exposure to toxins. The COVID pandemic has brought with it adversities with many dimensions, on such dimension is the improper and unscientific disposal of personal protection equipment such as masks, plastic body covers, face shields etc. This is putting an additional strain on the city authorities, who were already grappling with single use plastic menace. Thus, there exists a challenge of managing unusual waste sustainably using available waste facilities while reducing air pollution, preventing secondary viral transmission and mitigating potential health risk . Besides, there could be serious consequences for developing countries without standard waste management technologies and waste emergency policies to curb the pandemic.This research aims at providing a proper way for the disposal of COVID protection equipment in order to reduce its various impact on the environment."
133,BV811,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"The COVID-19 Pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, early childhood education and care (ECEC) services, universities and colleges. Most governments decided to temporarily close educational institutions in an attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19. New online programs have shifted the labour of education from schools to families and individuals, and consequently, people everywhere who relied on schools rather than computers and home life have had more difficulty accessing their education. The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work. In response to school closures, UNESCO recommended the use of distance learning programmes open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.Smart classrooms has been an extremely innovative idea in improving the ways of educating the newer generation. However, with the onset of COVID, the very premise of school education has gone for a toss. Many schools have come up with technological solutions for distance learning and several online education platforms have been offering plethora of courses at premium prices. Although, the affluent classes of the society may choose to opt from these options but the economically weaker section have nothing affordable for their children.The main objective of this research is to develop an effective way to provide education to the economically weaker sections of the country during these challenging times of COVID-19."

These systems are available to the general public, may require a fare, and run at scheduled times. The purpose of introducing or expanding public transportation is to increase access to and use of public transit while, at the same time, reducing motor vehicle miles driven and traffic congestion. Public transportation is one of the essential services operating during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This pandemic and related restrictions led to major transit demand decline for many public transit systems.The (COVID-19) pandemic had a large impact on Public transport. Many countries advised that public transport should only be used when essential; passenger numbers fell drastically, and services were reduced. Provision of a reasonable service for the much smaller number of fare-paying passengers incurred large financial losses. Researchers investigate for safe ways of public transport during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study finds that mandatory face masks and social distancing can allow for relatively safe public transport. But still people fear to use the public transports.Students are expected to suggest certain unique ideas that can make the use of public transport more even during these challenging times."

Informed by and responding to the common set of arguments used to exclude street vendors.Street vendors may contribute to congestion and grime but so do pedestrians, vehicles, the general public – and city governments that fail to regulate traf?c and provide sanitation services. While informally traded food and drink can pose public health risks, vendors would welcome more hygienic working conditions to attract customers and to ensure the safety of their goods. Moreover, where public sanitation services are not available, vendors often clean their areas of operation. In many cities, street vendors self-monitor and self-manage their vending sites to reduce congestion, crime, grime, and public health risks. Even after all these things they have to compromise on the Urban design and face a lot of things.The main objective of this task is to help the street vendors to get included in the public space development without compromising on the urban designing.Students are expected to suggest more improvised and redefined solution for conserving and reusing the rain water and reduce the water demand at source."
136,BV814,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"It is nearly impossible to trace back to which civilization used the method of rainwater harvesting first, but evidence shows that the basic design of these systems often involved a large rock formed into a basin using clay and other rocks to seal it from leaking. And then, using different diversion tactics, water would be stored and used for drinking, washing, agriculture and more. There began to be issues with the historic way of collecting rain. As civilizations grew, the cisterns would become more and more contaminated. This lead to the spreading of diseases since the modern technology was not available to remove bacteria. As countries became more developed, centralized water utilities began to sprout and became the primary source for all water needs.The age of rainwater harvesting has not reached its peak. Many farms continued to use rainwater cisterns for feeding livestock. And as technology developed in water treatment abilities, people started to use rainwater in their homes as the primary source of water yet again. Though Rain water is a lifeline there are lack of effective approaches in the current set up to conserve ,store and re use the rain water and reduce water demand at source.The main objective of this task is to help the city managers to adopt the decentralized approach of waste water management."
137,BV815,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"""Centralized wastewater systems are the most widely applied in well-developed urban environments and the oldest approach to the solution of the problems associated with wastewater. They collect wastewater in large and bulk pipeline networks, also referred as sewerage which transport it at long distances to one or several treatment plants. Storm water can be collected in either combined sewers or in a separate storm water drains. The latter consists of two separate pipeline systems, one for the wastewater and one for the storm water. The treated effluent is disposed in different ways, most often discharged into natural water bodies. The treated effluent may also be used for beneficial purposes and in this case it is referred as reclaimed water. The main difference between decentralized and centralized systems is in the conveyance structure. In decentralized systems the treatment and disposal or reuse of the effluent is close to the source of generation. This results in a small conveyance network, in some cases limited only to one pipeline. The size of the network allows for applications of different conveyance methods, in addition to the well-known gravity sewers, such as pressurized sewers and vacuum sewers. The quantity of the effluent is low and is characterized by significant fluctuations.Across pan India Mega/Metro cities are maintaining the centralised sewerage treatment
plants but most of the treatment plants could not attains its threshold limits always, either
it is under or over loaded. In the dynamic growth of the cities, adding any newly developed area in sustainability the existing system is time consuming process.
In locations with developed infrastructure, decentralized wastewater systems could be a viable alternative of the conventional centralized system, especially in cases of upgrading or retrofitting existing systems. Many different combinations and variations of hybrid systems are possible. The development of new treatment technologies allows for decentralized solutions, which are technically and aesthetically sound and acceptable.Sewerage blockage is one of the biggest challenges for the city managers in their day to day city operations.The main objective is to obtain effective solutions to overcome the above stated problem."""

This route also has sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows in the vicinity. The environmental impact of an oil spill from a tanker ship is well documented. Oil Spills do not occur instataneously. There are events e.g. machinary malfunction that lead to such disasters. Before a spill occurs the crew might be well aware of the challenging situation and often spend time in avoiding such an event. During such times, the ship movement behavior may change from its normal pattern i.e. travelling at a predicted speed towards the port of call. At present, however there is no mechanism that can look into such patterns and predict a potential spill event to mitigate it in timely manner.
While the tankers have AIS and the systems are 'on', only predictive models can help flag unusual behavior that need to be monitored. An open-source based solution (R, QGIS w/ GRASS) could consist of a model that feeds on the tanker AIS data. AI/ML/NN (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning / Neural Network) based system can assess the fresh AIS data with the historical data of a) the given ship, b) the given type of cargo menifested and c) the given region to flag any pattern (ship course, speed etc) that is unusual.

Even for fossil fuel-rich countries, climate sensitivity and targets are motivation to switch to alternate energy resources such as solar power. This ratio is poised to get further improve due to rollout of electric vehicles. Solar power genertaion capacity of a country depends on many factors. Since Asian countries such as India and ASEAN are within tropics, the day length is not a major concern for any part of the year. With governments facilitating rooftop solar model within the grids, gigentic areas for solar panel installation aren't mendatory. This leaves the air quality (haze) that determines what wavelengths and intensity of sunlight is received at ground level. Air pollutants have many sources, natural as well as anthropogenic. For both, the source need not to be near same place or even country. Massive duststorms or wildfires have been known to spread the haze across the continent. Due to solar power installation being at the base of it's exponential, it is not yet clear if and at what scale the air quality impacts on solar power generation.

186,SG864,International Council for Circular Economy (ICCE).,"Applying the circular economy principles properly can dramatically reshape the economics of plastics in the global economy while helping the environment. Recycling plastics has a great potential because here is a material that can be recycled many times while retaining its value and functional properties. It means that we need to increase the collection of plastic waste and India's recycling capacity. Innovation is the key and it needs to stimulate more methods of increasing recycling and the recyclability of plastic-containing products that further improve product design. There is great potential for economic gain but for this to happen we need multiple players across businesses and research communities to come together, to reconceive key material flows and manufacturing processes. All this needs to be supported by the proper policies and by sufficient investment.There is a requirement of reshaping the economics of plastic which could help the environment and also the global economy. Plastic is the only material which can be recycled multiple number of times and still hold an economic value in the market. Also recycling plastic can reduce environmental stress thus reducing pollution. This methodology show great potential in economic rise.We need a solution that highlights the bulk waste generators of the plastic waste and propose solutions and solution providers in the nearby areas. This would help to effectively and efficiently tackle the issue of plastic pollution on our land and sea and boost immediate action at national and local level in India and beyond."
187,SG865,International Council for Circular Economy (ICCE).,"Water pollution and the shortage in consumable water resources are big issues for our planet. As a result, some 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to water, and a total of 2.7 billion find water scarce for at least one month of the year. Many of the water systems that keep ecosystems thriving and feed a growing human population have become stressed. Rivers, lakes and aquifers are drying up or becoming too polluted to use. Also industries use water for production and discharge out the wastewater which becomes unusable for domestic use and cause pollution thus increasing the scarcity of water even more. There needs to be a way to treat this waste water making it useable again for the society. Industrial wastewater has become a major concern in this modern era where big industries use water and while discharges the polluted water back. Proper treatment of water is required in order to make the water reusable in the society. Treatment of water from such industries and industrial parks can effectively increase the reusability of water and cut off the shortage of fresh water supply. We are looking for ideas and solutions which would enable industrial wastewater to be properly treated, recycled and reused in a circular way to create and share domestic water efficiently. Please propose your idea, solution or technology which would contribute to efficiently using our valuable water resources.

189,SG867,International Council for Circular Economy (ICCE).,"The principles of the circular economy on the farming system ensure that important nutrients are returned to the soil through anaerobic processes or composting, which softens the exploitation of land and natural ecosystems. In this way, as “waste” is returned to the soil, besides having fewer residues to deal with, the soil gets healthier and more resilient, allowing a greater balance in the ecosystems that surround it. As well, since soil degradation costs an estimated US$40 billion annually worldwide, and has hidden costs such as the increase of fertilizer use, loss of biodiversity and loss of unique landscapes – a circular economy could prove to be really useful for both the soils and the economy. A circular economy model in food systems has the potential to decrease 80% of the use of artificial fertilizer and therefore contributing to the natural balance of soils, according to a study.Most of the waste food that is being generated is dumped in landfills. This was we are losing the opportunity to use the food waste in more better things such as creating organic fertilizers or biogas. Hence tracking this food waste can help in bringing out more productivity to the waste that is being generated.Tracking food waste can help divert it from entering the landfill towards more productive usage. We need you to use modern generation M.L based techniques to track out the amount of food waste and categories them on how and which sectors we can use that waste for more productive areas."
190,SS868,Ministry of Mines,"Due to underestimation and misidentification of the various grades of minerals, the economic development becomes stuck.Varied grades of the same material have different prices, royalty rates, and customs taxes. Producers have been known to misclassify one grade for another to pay a reduced royalty fee for that grade. State governments lose revenue as a result of this. Exporters have also been known to misclassify a grade with a higher export duty as a grade with a lower export charge. To take advantage of export duty differentials, exporters frequently misclassify iron ore (export duty 30%) as iron ore pellet (export duty 5%). The state suffers a revenue loss as a result of this. The state suffers a revenue loss as a result of this. The employment of advanced technology to distinguish between different grades of the same materials (e.g., different grades of iron ore, pellets) will be extremely valuable in preventing system leakages. Furthermore, a smart system that monitors or accounts for the transport/ movement of various grades of minerals from mines to endpoints such as processing units/factories and/or ports will aid in the prevention of leakages.

Despite the existence of traditional means, the process of seeking is still not faster.Finding economically viable mineral reserves has become increasingly difficult. The iterative process of collecting various datasets, followed by geological interpretation, might take a long period during exploration. Massive volumes of data are gathered and analyzed, frequently with no notable mineral discoveries. As a result, explorers are looking for novel tactics and processes that will increase finding rates and shorten the exploration life cycle. Using traditional approaches, possible mineral resources are now identified by overlaying numerous layers of geoscientific data in GIS software.

“modern-day slavery”, and this has prompted rapid proliferation of international, regional, and national anti-
trafficking laws, and inspired states to devote enormous financial and bureaucratic resources to its

eradication.
The Constitution of India, general criminal laws and special laws prohibits and criminalises human trafficking.
Article 23 of the constitution of India prohibits trafficking in human being and other similar forms of force
labour and pronounce that such acts are offences punishable in accordance with law. Article 24 of the

exploitation. Besides IPC, the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1956, Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the draft Trafficking of
Persons (Prevention, Protection, and Rehabilitation) Draft Bill, 2021 are some of the important mechanisms

213,ST892,National Institute of Design Madhya Pradesh,"""Overloading on highways and roads is a serious issue in India, as well as in other developing countries of the
world. Although the phenomenon of overloading is not new, so far not much discussion has been done on
vehicle overloading in developing countries. It is estimated that about over 50% of commercial vehicles
plying on India's national highways and state highways are overloaded. This is particularly serious in the
vicinity of mining areas. The legal axle load limits and gross vehicle weight limits are overlooked and violated
by the transporters. The problems resulting from overloading are manifold. Newly constructed roads
experience accelerated loading conditions resulting in loading to exceed the limits much before their design
life is over. This results in premature failure of roads. The maintenance aspect also becomes tricky due to
this factor with the consequent fallout as poor condition of roads or heavy maintenance cost required to
keep them in shape. Other negative effects of overloading include increased incidences of road accidents,
damage to vehicles, lower speeds and inefficiency, delays to vehicular traffic and congestion. Overloading of
vehicles is not only detrimental to the economic life of the highways and the roads on which the mechanical
vehicles ply but more importantly also leads to larger safety related issues. Hence, there is an urgent need to
spread awareness and alarming message to curb this practice. Together with this, methods have to be put in
place to identify and catch overloaded vehicles and take strict actions, including heavy penalties and seizure
of vehicles.
Recently, the Government has mandated the use of Fastag for payment toll collection at all National
Highways. Similarly, A mechanism can be developed by installation of electronic weighing machines at all toll
plazas on National Highways to prevent and detect overloading of commercial goods transport vehicles.
These automated electronic weighing machines would weigh the load of the vehicles and send the recorded
reading/information to the toll booth along with fastag details of the vehicle so weighed. The information
may be shared with the next toll booth at the highways where the penalties, if any, would levied and
deducted from the Fastag balance of the Vehicle. The integrated data of the vehicles can also be collected
and maintained for getting the details of vehicle which are usually involve in overloading.
The toll plazas are connected with network and are able to exchange vital information about the overloaded
vehicles. Application of such methods poses challenges, but output of such methods will be worth the
efforts.

Agencies presently also validate data from other sources such as AISHE, UGC, Funding agencies as well as institutional website. 
The present process of assessment and Accreditation is a benchmark driven ICT enabled process which involves the following steps
1. Registration: Higher Education Institution (HEI) applying for NAAC Assessment and Accreditation (A&A) process need to register themselves first. Those HEI who have not register on or after July  5th 2017 have to register themselves first through Apply Online Tab available on NAAC portal.
2. IIQA: Eligible HEIs seeking A&A are required to submit Institutional Information for Quality Assessment (IIQA) Online. Duly filled in IIQAs of eligible HEIs will be accepted by NAAC for further processing and others will be rejected.
3. SSR: After the acceptance of IIQA, the institution will be asked to fill the SSR with the required document to be uploaded in the portal of NAAC website within 45 days. The SSR of the HEI will then be subjected to further process. The SSR comprises both Qualitative and Quantitative metrics. The Quantitative Metrics (QnM) add up to about 70% and the remaining about 30% are Qualitative Metrics
4. DVV: The data submitted on Quantitative Metrics (QnM) will be subjected to validation exercise with the help of independent Data Validation and Verification (DVV) process as per the guidelines of NAAC  Pre-qualifier: The Quantitative Metrics (QnM) which is constitutes about 70% of SSR will be sent for Data Validation and Verification (DVV) Process. HEI that clears the DVV process will proceed for Peer Team Visit with a condition of a Pre-qualifier, that the HEI should score at least 25% in Quantitative Metrics (QnM) as per the final score after the DVV Process.  If the HEI does not clear the Pre-qualifier stage then they will have to apply afresh by submitting the IIQA and its fees. Such HEIs are eligible to apply again only after six months from the day of declaration of Pre-qualification status.
5. Student Satisfaction Survey (SSS): SSS will be conducted simultaneously with DVV process. 
Peer Team visit: After the DVV process, NAAC will intimate the HEI, within 10 days stating that they have successfully cleared the Pre-qualifier. This indicates that the institution has entered the next round of assessment to be done by the Peer Team during their on-site visit. The focus of Peer Team visit will be on the 30% Qualitative Metrics (QlM.

292,AD973,"Indian Knowledge System (IKS), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)","""There are lakhs of inscriptions that are scattered throughout the length and breadth of our Great Nation. These inscriptions were usually found on the walls of the Heritage sites like Forts. Temples and other ancient structures, so that people in that era could access them. A common man is deprived of this great knowledge, which if deciphered into Devanagari script can shed light into lot of crucial aspects for the mankind.
 Background- Inscriptions are a great source to look back to ancient history and learn from it, discover truths and may be secrets of life. Apart from the inscriptions in the country, there are inscriptions in Sri Lanka and South East Asia, where we can find abundant inscriptions in local languages, Sanskrit and Tamil. These inscriptions were mainly inscribed to propagate the orders of the rulers and to proclaim the grants and also other social activities. For example, through Uttaramerur Inscription in Tamil Nadu State, we can understand the excellent and perfect democratic set up that was present in our Nation that too 1000s of years before present.
In India, these inscriptions are almost in all the languages of the country. To show an example, the 436 Inscriptions that were dated before many years are in the languages viz.Sanskrit (verse), Sanskrit verse in Grantha, Sanskrit in Grantha, Sanskrit, Grantha & Sanskrit, Sanskrit verse in Nagari, Sanskrit in Grantha and Tamil, Sanskrit Nagari, Sanskrit Sarada, Sanskrit in Gaudiya, Sanskrit & Tamil, Sanskrit & Telugu, Sanskrit in Telugu & Telugu, Sanskrit in Kannada, Sanskrit verse in Malayalam, Oriya Sanskrit & Telugu,  Tamil Vatteluthu Sanskrit, Tamil in Grantha, Tamil Verse,  Tamil, Tamil Vatteluthu,  Vatteluthu,  Archiac Vatelluthu, Tamil & Telugu, Tamil & Kanarese, Tamil & English, Telugu, Kanarese, Kannada, Kannada in Nagari,  Kannada in Grantha,  Telugu & Kannada,  Malayalam,  Mahrathi, Mahrathi in Nagari,  Uriya/ Oriya,  Tamil Grantha & Mahrathi Nagari. Further, each language had many scripts in itself.
For example, Tamil language inscriptions had been inscribed in Tamil Vattelluthu, Archiac Vatteluthu, Tamil Pandya Grantha, Tamil Pallava Grantha, and later period Tamil letters which itself have a few varieties, at different period of time. In the same way, inscriptions in Sanskrit languages are inscribed not only in Nagari, Sarada, Mythili, Gaudiya and Deva Nagari scripts but also in local scripts. Brahmi and its local variants are important ancient scripts.
Walls, floors, plates, swords, stones, pillars in temples, coins and all remarkable monuments have inscriptions which are hidden treasure for lives to come. With the wisdom of our mighty kings, saints, philosophers, these inscriptions were carved. To gain insights in all areas such as politics, social values, economic and judicial records and approaches inscriptions are invaluable for an unbiased study of history and psychology. Many of the inscriptions are couched in extravagant language but when the information gained from inscriptions can be corroborated with information from other sources such as still existing monuments or ruins, inscriptions provide insight into India's dynastic history that otherwise lacks contemporary historical records.
Relevance/Detailed Description
Of the 1,00,000 inscriptions found by the Archaeological Survey of India, about 85% were found in South India and attempts are made to preserve and read them. The fact that they are carved in old scripts such as Prakrit, Sanskrit, Brahmi makes it difficult to understand and reach to the new generations in India, hence, newer ways of understanding and converting them in easy interpretable formats such as Devanagari script is utmost important.
Objectives
Epigraphical studies about ancient Indian Inscriptions must be made much smoother, interesting and insightful. Most appealing form of capturing the hidden meaning in these inscriptions, is to recognize them optically and deduce the inscripted messages into most commonly understandable scripts such as Devanagari. Devanagari is the widely used lipi or script that can be used as a result of OCR done on the images captured of these monuments with inscriptions.
Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support cultural and ancient wisdom upliftment and enrich understanding of Indian history and culture. 
The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solution which can use OCR techniques to transform inscriptions into meanings using easy Devanagari script and scales to reach to the common man in the country."""
293,AD974,"Indian Knowledge System (IKS), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)","""When a culturally diverse country like India is working on common goals yet preserving the local languages and cultures at regional level, sometimes communicating across, and communicating together in multiple languages over virtual medium becomes a hurdle while progressing, due to the very reason of not knowing other regional languages. This creates blocks and slows down the progress, apart from creating misunderstandings and inefficient use of time.
Background- The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement. According to the Census of India of 2001, India has 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to differences in definition of the terms """"language"""" and """"dialect"""". The 2001 Census recorded 30 languages which were spoken by more than a million native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people
While newer challenges India is facing in the areas of agriculture, environmental imbalances, cultural brain drains, political instability and the most recent pandemic affects, it is most important to come together to brainstorm and work on solutions collaboratively, come up with PAN India communication solution irrespective of language and culture differences. Giant Indian industries having widespread operations across Indian geography attract local talent, however making them communicate and collaborate to resolve issues. With people working on better opportunities, but across their regional periphery, makes them uncomfortable and less productive sometimes.
Thus, communication now needs to be faster and seamless despite members lack cross language communication skills. Indian government is also working on a technology that can translate in real-time various vernacular Indian languages to enable the exchange of communications between two persons not speaking the same language.
This will bridge boundaries and make us progress.
Relevance/Detailed Description
As we know, the recent pandemic has forced us adopt newer ways of working and world has come closer. As much as communicating in foreign language is difficult for an individual in India to work with a team member in China region (who mostly prefers to talk in Chinese) Or a German colleague (who use their native language to the fullest), it also becomes a barrier for an Indian person or citizen to interact with other people from different Indian States speaking different and unknown language.
In such a situation, for ex. when a Maharashtrian person needs to share the information from the ancient Indian literature in Maharashtrian texts in his/her respective regional language with the other person from Bengal or Andhra Pradesh, he or she may pose a hurdle in the work, if he/she lacks the language skills.
There arises a need to support agile communication in different languages seamlessly without having to bother about the language expertise. This necessitates need to develop a solution by means of which we can achieve real time translation of one language into another. The real time means, on the fly translation as one speaks.
Our prime minister Shri. Narendra Modi has chosen his speech language as “Hindi” no matter which country he speaks. This one example necessitates an efficient real time language translation system that makes the message reach the world in each of the member’s preferred language.
Language as a barrier is to be swept and communications need to be more inclusive and seamless with the use of digital technology – is what Government of India is striving to achieve in coming few years (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology declared recently).
Objectives
Develop a technology that enables Real-Time translations of regional languages and hence language doesn’t become barrier between interpersonal, social or corporate communication.
Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this technology and generate feature-rich application that applies at one or more scenarios and helps businesses. 
The objective of this problem statement resolution is also to come up with innovative application, service and/or integration which can convert one language speech into another on the fly using comprehensive Artificial Intelligence algorithms and deliver end to end solution."""
294,AD975,"Indian Knowledge System (IKS), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)","""Indian history dates to the life when Vedic and other ancient Indian literature guided mankind to live life in a way to achieve the ultimate. The knowledge in Vedas and related texts includes numerous principles which are useful and relevant even today. This documentation is vast and there is a need of a search engine that can be used to find the similar words, texts in this ocean of literature. Background- The word ‘Veda’ means ‘knowledge’ and is derived from the Sanskrit root ‘vid’, means ‘to know’. It does not refer to one single literary work, but indicates a huge corpus of literature, which arose in the course of many centuries and has been handed down from one generation to another generation by verbal transmission.
According to Indian traditional thoughts ‘Veda’ is regarded as revealed scripture, self-evident, and self-authoritative. It is not composed by any human authors. The Vedic hymns (Suktas) or verses (Mantras) are seen and only spoken by the seers (Rishis). These seers are neither author of the Mantras nor are they responsible for the contents of the Mantras. Yaska, the oldest expositor of Veda, has distinctly said that these seers received the sacred knowledge or knowledge was revealed to them. They then handed it down to descendants by oral instruction.
The significance of the Veda is manifold.
It has been universally acknowledged that the Veda is the earliest available literature of humanity.
The Veda in the form of prose and poetry in Sanskrit language, has been regarded as authoritative knowledge. Its authority seems to have remained unquestioned for several millennia, and it has been considered the last tribunal in matters of dispute whether in religion or philosophy or social customs. 
There are four Vedas that govern a person’s life and values, so that she/he lives peacefully starting from the birth until the death. Guidance in vedas would lead the person to think holistically and tune lifeline according to tatvas (principles) given in all the vedas namely the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda.
Holy hymns and Sanskrit mantras described in Vedas are life’s ultimate meanings. The Rigveda Samhita is the oldest extant Indic text. It is a collection of 1,028 Vedic Sanskrit hymns and 10,600 verses in all, organized into ten books (Sanskrit: mandalas). The hymns are dedicated to Rigvedic deities. While India has history of establishment of Vedas, due to its rich philosophy, world acknowledged and started adopting Sanskrit studies and Vedabhyasa.
Relevance/Detailed Description
There are similarities between the mythology, rituals, and linguistics in Rigveda and those found in ancient central Asia, Iranian and Hindukush (Afghanistan) region. The study of Sanskrit in the West began in the 17th century. In the early 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer drew attention to Vedic texts, specifically the Upanishads. The importance of Vedic Sanskrit for Indo-European studies was also recognized in the early 19th century. English translations of the Samhitas were published in the later 19th century, in the Sacred Books of the East series edited by Müller between 1879 and 1910. Ralph T. H. Griffith also presented English translations of the four Samhitas, published 1889 to 1899.
Rigveda manuscripts were selected for inscription in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2007. 
This increases the responsibility of India to preserve Vedic knowledge that’s laid down by the ancestors and transmit them to the next generations and to the outer world. 
This means to search for Vedic hymns, chants, scripts from all avenues effectively, a well-designed system needs to be established.

Objectives
Develop a search engine which effectively searches words in Vedic literature. For ex: If we search a word ‘Indra’, it should search all the hyms and bring out all the suktas related with Indra or all the mantras that include the word Indra. Also, this engine is required to sort all the Suktas, Mantras, Mandalas, Kandas etc. in the Vedas or related texts as per the desired words entered into the engine.
Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this search engine and generate feature-rich application that applies at one or more scenarios and helps us build Vedic database subject wise.

With specially abled children, the assessment of disability and learning absorption is important and especially children with deeper issues, slow learning is the most common behavior. There could be many issues that make learning slow. Some of them could be mental and brain disorders, social issues, auditory issues, visual-motor issues or language issues or sensory organ issues. The result of this is dis-harmony in the education, attention disorders and derailing of motivation. 
Present education systems are unable to detect slow learning phenomenon and hence not able to supplement measures to overcome it . This affects children and morale of the parents and society. We need innovative identication mechanism which detect slow learning and be able to track, notify guardians, suggest measures and implement them to make education more effective and peaceful.The State Education Report for India 2019: Children with disabilities by UNESCO states that 27% of disabled children between the age of 5-19 years don’t have access to education. It also says that nearly 3/4th of 5-years old specially abled are left out of the education system, further revealing that this ratio varies gender wise and girls tend to show in high numbers when it comes to depriving education

It is the need that differently abled persons need special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning, at the same time, to absorb the knowledge fully and respond, they need the education delivery mechanism to be predictive of their reflexes and absorptions of the knowledge. 
Effects of unidentified Slow learning in children has led to many behavioral complications, mental depression in children and social effects on the others around. It is of paramount importance to address this in the education delivery and devise ways to detect, correct and prevent. This problem statement needs holistic solutions that may be hybrid in nature.
Objective of this problem statement is to develop innovative application which helps identify slow learners, be able to support them via innovative means. 
Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support education delivery effectiveness of specially abled children into educational ecosystem and generate insights based on data it collected
The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solution which may use digital and physical medium together to make sure specially abled students who are slow learners are identified , their progress is monitored and right alarms and notifications are generated to assist keeping their education on track with elevated motivation. The solution may use technologies like Artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things and blockchain to ensure specially abled children are given right systems and interfaces to learn and grow.

India has committed to be Net Zero by 2070 with various short-term goals including: Reaching a non-fossil fuel energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030. Fulfilling 50 percent energy requirements via renewable energy by 2030 Reducing CO2 emissions by 1 million tons by 2030; and Reducing carbon intensity below 45 percent by 2030. India’s climate change targets are laudable and put the ball firmly in the court of the already rich world to now show that they mean business. This is because, India has not been a historical contributer to the greenhouse gas emissions — from 1870 to 2019, its emissions have added up to a miniscule 4 per cent of the global total. It is lambasted as the world’s third highest polluter in 2019, but its scale of emissions, 2.88 CO2 gigatonnes (Gt). And, we have a huge need to grow our economy and to meet the energy needs of millions of our people. So, from every angle, we did not have to take these global targets to reduce our carbon emissions. This is why, it is not just a challenge to achieve for India but also a challenge for the world to follow suit. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global CO2 emissions must be 18.22 Gt in 2030 for the world to stay below 1.5°C rise in temperature. If we take the global population in 2030 and divide this amount, it would mean that the entire world has to be 2.14 tonnes per capita of CO2 in 2030. We need you to develop a method To positively contribute towards the Net Zero Emission Target, what initiatives should India take pertaining to various segments in the tourism sector?"
343,PK1026,Ministry of Tourism,"Most tourism-related activities require energy directly in the form of fossil fuels or indirectly in the form of electricity often generated from petroleum, coal or gas. This consumption leads to the emission of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide. Tourism is not a traditional sector in the System of National Accounts and as a result no country possesses comprehensive national statistics on the energy demand or emissions specifically resulting from tourism. But tourism activity can leave behind a massive amount of carbon footprint. This carbon emissions come from transport, hotels, exploring activities and various other methods where there is a need to move around and explore new places. Hence all activities in tourism sector can be considered to be affecting the climate. We need you to develop a proof of concept which can measure the carbon footprint of various activities and provide a detailed statistical data of the entire model."
344,PK1027,Ministry of Tourism,"The COVID-19 has spread to 200 countries, having an impact on global academic exchanges and the international flow of students, and it has also triggered people's reflection on ecological civilization. The impact of greenhouse gases, led by carbon dioxide, on the earth and the environment has already sounded the alarm for mankind. This is a fact that has been widely demonstrated internationally. Climate change problems have become a worldwide concern. It has become a global consensus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and actively respond to climate change. The tourism carbon footprint can be used to obtain the carbon dioxide content consumed by tourism in a certain area during a certain period. Between 2009 and 2013, the global carbon footprint of the tourism industry increased from 3.9 to 4.5 GtCO2e, four times the previous estimate, accounting for approximately 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. We need you to develop a model which would show the estimate of CO2 Emissions in tourism and also create a model which can help in reducing the CO2 emissions from all type of tourist activities."
345,PK1028,Ministry of Tourism,"Tourism is one of the world’s major economic sectors. It is the third-largest export category (after fuels and chemicals) and in 2019 accounted for 7% of global trade.

Natural disasters have a catastrophic impact on the lives of humans, interrupting their social and economic activities to a great extent. Communities that are located in high-risk regions encounter greater challenges in developing a resilient and sustainable tourism economy. The past examples of tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions all over the world have shown that there are two sides of the issue in terms of tourism sector. First, the devastating effects of the natural disaster slow down the tourism sector like all other activities in a particular destination. On the other hand, the natural disasters are capable of fostering the strong feelings of solidarity luring the global interest to the region for further economic opportunities, including tourism. Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, impacting economies, livelihoods, public services and opportunities on all continents. All parts of its vast value-chain have been affected. As countries gradually lift travel restrictions and tourism slowly restarts in many parts of the world, health must continue to be a priority and coordinated heath protocols that protect workers, communities and travellers, while supporting companies and workers, must be firmly in place. Only through collective action and international cooperation will we be able to transform tourism, advance its contribution. We are stronger together. A roadmap to transform tourism needs to address five priority areas. Mitigate socio-economic impacts on livelihoods, particularly women’s employment and economic security. Boost competitiveness and build resilience, including through economic diversification, with promotion of domestic and regional tourism where possible, and facilitation of conducive business environment for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Advance innovation and digital transformation of tourism, including promotion of innovation and investment in digital skills, particularly for workers temporarily without jobs and for job seekers. Foster sustainability and green growth to shift towards a resilient, competitive, resource efficient and carbon-neutral tourism sector. Green investments for recovery could target protected areas, renewable energy, smart buildings and the circular economy, among other opportunities. Coordination and partnerships to restart and transform sector towards achieving SDGs, ensuring tourism’s restart and recovery puts people first and work together to ease and lift travel restrictions in a responsible and coordinated manner.[UNWTO]. We should be dealing with the question how natural disasters and pandemic like COVID19 have an impact on tourism through economic aspects, destination image and the degree of community activity and what measures do we need to take to bring the tourism industry back to life. Keeping the above points in mind, an innovative approach should be developed to bring the tourism industry back to life. There could be several approaches to tackle this and below are some suggestions which we think are the one of the few possibilities, as possibilities are immense, it only needs to be explored more and more.

For a nation which possesses an abundance of tourism richness in remote communities, homestays are an attractive alternative tourism product. It was also homestay hosting is beneficial to host families as it offers social interaction and preservation of local culture, a sense of local pride, income and employment and educational opportunities for operators' children such as becoming more multilingual. Even in this era, although tourism industry is booming due to promotions and regulations yet the homestay ecosystem is not much looked into because of lack of promotion on social media. This prevents the homestay ecosystem people from investing more into making the homestay more better for tourists. Also proper regulation of the ecosystem throughout the country should be done to keep the industry growing. Keeping the above points in mind, an innovative approach should be developed to bring the homestay tourism to life. There could be several approaches to tackle this and below are some suggestions which we think are the one of the few possibilities, as possibilities are immense, it only needs to be explored more and more. The main goal of the solution proposed should be to develop a solution which aims at promoting and regulating homestay ecosystem throughout the country to maintain its general standard.

349,PK1032,Ministry of Tourism,"Customer Engagement is the emotional connection between a customer and a brand. Highly engaged customers buy more, promote more, and demonstrate more loyalty. Providing a high-quality customer experience is an important component in your customer engagement strategy. Customer engagement is one of the most pressing issues for marketers today. Why? Because it underscores the entire reason why marketers market: to build relationships with customers that will ensure they choose you over the competition, enjoy and benefit from your product or service, keep coming back for more, and tell their friends, family or colleagues to try it too. In order to acquire, convert, retain customers – and turn them into advocates – you need to engage them. To connect with them in an appropriate, effective and meaningful way. Brands can’t just rely on catchy slogans or celebrity endorsements anymore. Thanks to social media and mobile phones, businesses and brands have to be always “on”, ready to take on opportunities to engage with customers anywhere, anytime. Customer engagement is all the ways you interact with customers, both online and offline. Can this be used for branding the destinations and tourists spots?

Pumped storage is well established. Other megawatt-scale technologies are being developed. These can provide dispatchable capacity as required by demand. The storage to complement intermittent renewables if they are to replace base-load capacity must be able to meet demand over many days, not simply hours. At household level, behind the meter, battery storage is being promoted to complement solar PV installation. It reduces demand on the grid during evening peaks especially.The rapid increase in many parts of the world of generating capacity by intermittent renewable energy sources, notably wind and solar, has led to a strong incentive to develop energy storage for electricity on a large scale. Due to the (desired or imposed) growing annual share of electrical energy originating from renewable technologies subject to naturally-fluctuating power flows (like solar PV and wind), characterised by relatively low load factors, the combined installed capacities of those technologies in the future are expected to be much larger than typical/conventional electrical peak power demand."

In rural areas, the provision of utilities to drain sewage in a safe way lags behind the provision of water for household activities, including drinking water. This creates severe contamination to the environment of the various villages and reduces the impact of water on the improvement of health.
 Since the water supply for domestic purposes in rural areas has improved considerably over the years, the quantity of wastewater that is disposed has also increased. Hence, effective wastewater management systems need to be introduced in the rural areas to mitigate the problem of contamination.Wastewater treatment is interconnected with the water chain, and thus affects the environment.

 Stopping false alarms is important so as not to cause unnecessary warnings to the owners, the police or the surveillance company. When false alarms are continuous it can also cause an unwanted effect: we relax and do not give importance to the true alarm when it occurs.

The quality and efficiency of logistics services can matter for international trade as a weak logistics infrastructure and operational processes can be a major obstacle to global trade integration.
 
 Transport and logistics is a sector in which global value chains (GVCs) play a vital role in connecting countries, spreading technology, and promoting best practice around the world. The transport and logistics GVC is notable for the variety of lead firms involved in it—including major shipping, express delivery, and freight forwarding firms—and the range of local operators they partner with. Increasingly, transport and logistics GVCs are extending their reach into developing countries.
 
 The fragmented market of freight transportation imposes several inefficiency costs as a result of delay, double-spending, disputes, and cancellations. While in such competitive market, every player seeks its own profit, optimisation at individual level also becomes harder due to invisibility and disconnectivity. Although tackling some of these issues are doable by synchronization, encryption and integration, it seems that other emerging technologies can also be applied for finding and developing a solution. 
 
 Logistic companies face few major problems during delivery service. First of all, is dependence on a middleman, which connects messengers and clients, and process all the information for delivery manually, moreover increasing the price for delivery. Second, the utilization of Big Data. Many deliveries and logistics companies don’t use the data that they have, cannot set up new settings and offers for their users. Third, up to 30% of all products ordered online become returns, placing an insurmountable burden on reverse logistics.

392,LC1075,Ministry of External Affairs (MEA),"""Today is your first day in a new role at a multinational organization. Your team is dispersed across the globe, and many of your co-workers don’t speak your native language. After making the proper introductions, your supervisor asks you to complete an online training course — which also isn’t in your native language. You manage to fumble your way through the course but, since you don’t understand the content, finish it feeling more confused than when you started.
 
 While this scenario may seem extreme, it’s a reality for the many employees around the world who must attempt to learn in a non-native language.
 
 The world is growing more interconnected and mobile by the day: more companies are opening operations and branches in various locations around the world, creating an increasing need to co-ordinate and communicate transnationally. That poses a full gamut of tricky issues. Take language barriers: colleagues living in different counties might not necessarily speak the same language – and linguistic misunderstandings can have costly consequences.
 
 Already in 2012, a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit found that half of 572 executives polled by the organisation thought that uncertainties with language and “messages lost in translation” had negatively impacted their business by hampering international deals. And that is just one barrier to communication. A range of other hurdles are also emerging as key challenges, including cultural barriers, accessibility issues, and outdated technological tools that hamper the beneficial exchange of information, when they are actually supposed to aid it.
 
 As the world shrinks, the goal of achieving effective and frictionless communication has become more urgent and multi-layered for companies.
 
 So, the aim is to create a solution that can aid in bridging the language barriers in day to day life."""
393,LC1076,Ministry of External Affairs (MEA),"""Email spoofing is a form of cyber attack in which a hacker sends an email that has been manipulated to seem as if it originated from a trusted source.
 This kind of identity deception is widely used in phishing and spam attacks to help boost the open rate and efficacy of malicious emails. In many email attacks, embedded links lead to phishing sites designed to swipe sensitive information or login credentials from recipients. Others contain malware-laden attachments, or employ social engineering to bamboozle well-researched targets out of money in spear-phishing or business email compromise (BEC) scams.
 
 In order to spoof an email, all a fraudster needs to do is set up or compromise an SMTP server. From there, they can manipulate the ‘From’, ‘Reply-To’, and ‘Return-Path’ email addresses to make their phishing emails appear to be legitimate messages from the individual or brand they’re impersonating.
 
 This identity deception is made possible by the fact that SMTP—the Simple Message Transfer Protocol used by email systems to send, receive, or relay outgoing emails—lacks a mechanism for authenticating email addresses. It’s also exacerbated when exploited through popular cloud-based email platforms such as Gmail and Office 365.
 
 Because of their ubiquity and the precipitous volume of emails distributed by these and other email platforms, phishing attacks launched from cloud email accounts are far less likely to be detected and blocked than those sent from a lookalike domain.
 
 Hence, the objective is to find a solution and suggest a mechanism that can filter the spoofed email at server only."""

An Arbitral Award has the same binding effect and it is enforced under the Code of Civil Procedure in the same manner as a decree of a Court.
 
 Mediation is an alternative method of resolving disputes without resorting to the courts. It is a structured, voluntary and interactive negotiation process where a neutral third-party uses specialized communication and negotiation techniques to help the parties in fulfilling their stated objectives.

 Challenges that can be faced with centralised implementation can be related to the time of implementation of GIS at ports. With some ports having implemented the systems in later period, their contracts with the GIS implementation agency would still be valid for some time.

One District One Product (ODOP) is an initiative which is seen as a transformational step forward towards realizing the true potential of a district, fuel economic growth and generate employment and rural entrepreneurship, taking us to the goal of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. One District One Product (ODOP) initiative is operationally merged with 'Districts as Export Hub' initiative being implemented by DGFT, Department of Commerce, with Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) as a major stakeholder. The Department of Commerce through DGFT is engaging with State and Central government agencies to promote the initiative of One District One Product. The objective is to convert each District of the country into an Export Hub by identifying products with export potential in the District, addressing bottlenecks for exporting these products, supporting local exporters/manufacturers to scale up manufacturing, and find potential buyers outside India with the aim of promoting exports, promoting manufacturing & services industry in the District and generate employment in the District. To increase exports and take export promotion to the District level, Department of Commerce through the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) is engaging with State / UT Governments to implement the said initiative in all districts of the country in a phased manner, with the objective of mobilizing the potential of each district of the country to achieve its potential as an export hub. Under the initial phase of the ODOP programme, 106 Products have been identified from 103 districts across 27 States. Massive Skill development initiatives in the domains of local products and services will be required for the promotion of the scheme.

In Covid scenario, students are primarily studying in online mode and even if some workshop/ lab based on courses are conducted on campus, its optional for the students to join on campus and due to personal reasons and impact of covid on families, some students study in online mode. For education like Design education and other workshop/ lab-based education, students need these facilities to work on their assignments and projects. To facilitate students to utilize the facilities of Institutions closer to their hometowns, a collective database could be prepared for such facilities. These could be booked by studentsfor specific job works and duration through their Institutions and with prior approvals. Each Institution may specify financial charges for such facilities, which may be paid by the parent Institutions or students themselves depending on the scenario whether for the specific job work, parent Institution had to provide the facility to the student or not. Payment terms for a Security Amount and the charges for usage could be specified by each Institution. This could be planned and implemented through a web-based portal. Such a solution would lead to more judicious utilization of resources and assets at national level and would benefit students staying across the country. It will have a significant impact on education and skill development at national level even in post-covid scenario"
